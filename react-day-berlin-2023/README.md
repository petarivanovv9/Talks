# Building Enterprise-grade GraphQL APIs with Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture

In this talk, we will explore how to build scalable and maintainable GraphQL APIs for enterprise applications using Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture patterns.

We will discuss the importance of modularizing your API around the business domain and better subdomain organization.

We will briefly go through the main components of a GraphQL API, including resolvers, domain layer, and database layer and how we've evolved them to our new architecture.
